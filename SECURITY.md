# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The provider is pre-1.0 and follows semantic versioning on the `0.x` line. Security fixes are released as a new patch of the **latest 0.x minor release** (currently `0.10.x`); older minor releases do not receive backported fixes.

| Version                         | Supported          |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Latest 0.x minor (e.g. 0.10.x)  | :white_check_mark: |
| Older 0.x minors (e.g. 0.9.x)   | :x: upgrade to the latest release |

See the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) and [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/JDetmar/pulumi-webflow/releases) for the current version.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via one of the following methods:

1. **GitHub Security Advisories (Preferred)**: Use the [Security Advisories](https://github.com/JDetmar/pulumi-webflow/security/advisories/new) feature to privately report the vulnerability.

2. **GitHub Discussions (non-sensitive questions only)**: For general security questions that do not disclose a vulnerability, open a [discussion](https://github.com/JDetmar/pulumi-webflow/discussions).

This is a community-maintained project with a single maintainer; there is no dedicated security team or paid support, and the response timeline below is a best-effort commitment.

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact of the vulnerability
- Any suggested fixes (if applicable)

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours of receiving your report
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days with an assessment and remediation plan
- **Resolution**: Depending on complexity, typically within 30 days

### What to Expect

1. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours.
2. **Assessment**: We will investigate and assess the severity of the issue.
3. **Communication**: We will keep you informed of our progress.
4. **Resolution**: Once fixed, we will release a patch and credit you (unless you prefer to remain anonymous).
5. **Disclosure**: We will coordinate with you on public disclosure timing.

## Security Best Practices for Users

### API Token Security

- **Never commit API tokens** to version control
- Use `pulumi config set webflow:apiToken <token> --secret` to securely store tokens
- Alternatively, use the `WEBFLOW_API_TOKEN` environment variable
- Rotate tokens regularly
- Use tokens with minimal required permissions

### Infrastructure Security

- Review Pulumi state files for sensitive data before sharing
- Use Pulumi's built-in encryption for secrets
- Consider using Pulumi Cloud or a secure backend for state storage

## Security Features

This provider implements several security measures:

- **TLS 1.2+**: All API communications enforce TLS 1.2 or higher
- **Token Redaction**: API tokens are never logged in plain text
- **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated before API calls
- **Rate Limiting**: Automatic retry with backoff for rate-limited requests
- **SBOM Generation**: Software Bill of Materials included with releases
- **SLSA Build Level 2 Provenance**: Build provenance attestations for Go binaries produced via standard GitHub Actions workflows (verifiable with `gh attestation verify`; not SLSA Level 3)
- **Signed Package Releases**: npm and PyPI packages published with Sigstore attestations
